    As I reflected on the completion of my manuscript on my life with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, I asked myself a question whether, given the choice, I would have chosen to have it. Who would want to be diagnosed with a chronic, neurodegenerative illness, for which there is no cure? Who would want to experience a continuous tremor in one hand, and a dropped foot making walking difficult? Who would want to experience anxiety, depression and insomnia? Who would want to have cognitive impairment making communication difficult at times?
    Over the past ten years I have experienced many of these symptoms so I do feel that I have enough authority to have asked that question. And, as strange as it may seem, I came to the conclusion that I would have chosen to have it. Let me explain why.
